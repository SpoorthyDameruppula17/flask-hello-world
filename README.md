## DevOps Internship Task Submission – Spoorthy

Hello World Flask App with Jenkins CI/CD and Docker:-

This project is a simple "Hello World" Flask web application set up with CI/CD using Jenkins and Dockerized for deployment, built as part of the JarNox DevOps Internship Assignment.



## Objective:-

To demonstrate a basic DevOps workflow that includes:

   1. A simple web app (Flask)
   2. Docker containerization
   3. Jenkins pipeline for Continuous Integration and Deployment
   4. Triggering builds via a Git repository (GitHub)



## Tech Stack:-
  
  - Python + Flask – for the web app.
  - Docker – to containerize the app.
  - Jenkins – for automation (CI/CD)
  - GitHub – as the source code repository
  - Codeberg webhook / GitHub – to trigger Jenkins builds



## Features:-

  - Shows “Hello, World!” on the web page.
  - Dockerfile builds the app into a container.
  - Jenkinsfile automates the build and run process.
  - Pipeline triggers automatically when code is pushed.



## How It Works:-
  
  1. Flask app created (app.py) to return a simple message.
  2. Dockerfile builds the app image.
  3. Jenkinsfile defines a 3-stage pipeline:

    - Clone Repo
    - Build Docker Image
    - Run Container
  4. Jenkins listens for push events from GitHub.
  5. When code is pushed, Jenkins:

    - Clones the repo
    - Builds the Docker image
    - Runs the container



## Project Structure:-

  1. app.py            # Flask web app
  2. Dockerfile        # Docker image instructions         
  3. Jenkinsfile        # Jenkins pipeline
  4. README.md
